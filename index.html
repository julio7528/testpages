                    <h2>How Much Data Can The IoT Collect?</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>In 2019, the estimated volume of data in zettabytes (a trillion gigabytes) from the IoT was 13.6. In 2025, it’s estimated to be 79.4.</p>
                        <p>The average data companies manage, however, can vary. Usually, it’s anywhere from 47.81 terabytes (TB) for the average small business to 347.56TB for the average enterprise.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge With Implementing IoT Networks</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>The IoT empowers organizations to increase productivity, streamline workflows and redefine how a business operates. The data streams it provides can move across a range of IT infrastructures. Innovation is essentially constant, with new apps and features added daily.</p>
                        <p>When you start connecting more and more devices on the IoT, you face an increasingly vast data lake with streams flowing into it constantly. Thus, the challenge quickly shifts from capturing data to managing data. And that can create a major bottleneck for growing businesses.</p>

                    <h3>How Can IoT Networks and Low-Code Support Business Functions?</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>Low-code platforms are Software as a Service (SaaS) interfaces designed to streamline the development of applications and integrations. In short, they’re an incredibly agile way to build apps. Rather than building up complex custom applications from scratch, you simply drag and drop bits of code or visual elements to create the solutions you need. (Also read: Is No-Code Development About to Go Mainstream?)</p>
                        <p>This drastically reduces the time and cost needed to build custom applications. Instead of spending seven figures on custom app development and waiting months to test and go live, you can design custom software solutions in days.</p>
